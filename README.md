# TCP-Client-Server
A multi-threaded TCP Client and Server implementation in Java to run shell command in the Server using a client GUI


# Running
To run the system you need two parts, client and server. 
  # Client
  For client, go to TCP-Client-Server/src/lab02_client/ and rum Main.java(From IDE or from terminal). It will open up a GUI for you where you can give an command to run on your server.
  # Server
  For server, TCP-Client-Server/src/lab02_server/ and run TCPServer.java(From IDE or from terminal). It will run and server at localhost(127.0.0.1) at port 6789.
  
You can change the Server address from TCP-Client-Server/src/lab02_client/TCPClient.java at line 20!
